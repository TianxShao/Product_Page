            <h1>NES</h1>
            <p>The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced by Nintendo. It was first released as the Family Computer (FC), commonly known as the Famicom, in 1983 in Japan. The NES, a redesigned version, was released in American test markets in October 1985, before becoming widely available in the rest of North America and other countries.</p>

            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>The NES was one of the bestselling consoles of its time, and helped revitalize the US game industry following the video game crash of 1983. It introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers to produce and distribute games. The NES featured a number of groundbreaking games, such as the platform game Super Mario Bros. and the action-adventure games The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, which became long-running franchises.</p>

            <h2>The NES controller</h2>
            <p>The game controller for both the NES and the Famicom has an oblong brick-like design with a simple four button layout: two round buttons labeled "A" and "B", a "START" button, and a "SELECT" button. Additionally, the controllers utilize the cross-shaped joypad, designed by Nintendo employee Gunpei Yokoi for Nintendo Game & Watch systems, to replace the bulkier joysticks on earlier gaming consoles' controllers.</p>
